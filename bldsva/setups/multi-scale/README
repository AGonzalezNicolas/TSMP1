;Default setup creates run with 960 m resolution
./setup_tsmp.ksh -v 1.2.0MCT -V "multi-scale" -c "clm-pfl"

# To change grid resolution
Each folder 
d120  d240  d480  d960	
contains a setup script specific to the grid resolution:

#Copy this script to the outside folder and run setup, e.g, for 120 m resolution:
cp d120/multi-scale_CLUMA2_setup.ksh .
>>This will switch the grid resolution you want to use for the run!
