#Specific Changes to be made for GNU compiler:#

#Use the configure_machine script to apply them all.  #FGa
#edit the SVAROOT env in configure_machine if "$HOME/coup_oas" is not intended as sva-directory #FGa

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
OASIS3
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Change the include file "/home/pshrestha/coup_oas/oasis3/util/make_dir/make.inc"
USE "make.gnu_cluma_oa3" for GNU compiler

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CLM3.5
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Change DUMMY in "/home/pshrestha/coup_oas/clm/bld/Makefile.in" to mpif90
And replace mpif90 in "ifort" settings to DUMMY. This is clumsy.....

Comment out declared variables "system" and "chdir" in "/bld/usr.src/shr_sys_mod.F90"

Comment out declared variable "system" in "/bld/usr.src/m_FileResolv.F90"
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ParFlow
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please copy the files from ./parflow to  /coup_oas/parflow/pfsimulator/amps/oas3/
These changes are needed due to difference in variable names assigned by GNU and 
Intel compilers for C-Fortran interface.
