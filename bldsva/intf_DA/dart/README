DART interface with component models of TerrSysMP

So you can follow the following steps to download the code on your machine:

git clone https://git.meteo.uni-bonn.de/git/terrsysmp
cd terrsysmp 
git checkout -b issue428

We want to have the terrsysmp-dart interfaces in the following folder:
~/terrsysmp/bldsva/intf_DA/dart/

Prabhakar
PS: The wiki also has some notes on the git usage. 
We have just moved into a new configuration tool for terrsysmp interface.
The git only maintains the terrsysmp interface now, not the source codes 
of the component models, which can be downloaded from the respective servers 
of the component models.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
The terrsysmp/bldsva/intf_DA/dart directories and files are intended 
to be 'installed' (i.e. recusively copied) to the DART/models/terrsysmp  directory. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
When you get your local repository to the point you want to share it with
me or the other people on the project, you can 'push' this to the terrsysmp
server:

git push origin issue428

----------------------------------------------------------------------
When you want to make sure your local repository is up-to-date with respect 
to the central server, you need to 'pull' to get the latest, greatest.

git pull --rebase origin issue428
